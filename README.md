# 🛋️ IKEA Display Tracker

A simple internal tool to help IKEA staff track and manage floor display items by department.

## 📋 About

I'm currently working at IKEA as a part-time employee, and I noticed how difficult it is for coworkers to know what's currently on display—especially when covering shifts in other departments. So I decided to build this as a personal project to improve team communication and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features

- View display items by department (Living Room, Kitchen, Workspace, etc.)
- Add new items with optional descriptions and images
- Remove items when taken off the floor
- Simple and minimal design for quick use on the job

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(possibly React)*
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Hosting: Vercel / Render
